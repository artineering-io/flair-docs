## Delete PaintFX
Deleting _PaintFX_ can be useful in a various situations
* To start using _PaintFX_ again from scratch
* To reduce file size, while keeping the _PaintFX_ values in the exported file
* To recover the construction history of the vertex color sets to animate _PaintFX_ (remember to export the current _PaintFX_ first and import them back in afterwards)

To use it, simply select the objects from which you'd like to remove the _PaintFX_, and click on the **Delete PaintFX** button.

If nothing is selected, the tool will try to delete the _PaintFX_ of **ALL** objects in the scene.

## Auto-convert Maya materials
_Auto-convert Maya materials_ will automatically try to convert all Maya materials in the scene to _MNPRX_ materials, inheriting attributes and textures. This is especially useful for quickly loading existing _Maya_ scenes and seeing how they render with _MNPRX_.


## Unsubdivide Previews
_Unsubdivide Previews_ can be useful in a various situations where you need to work with light meshes.
* When using the _Velocity PV_ attribute in the [style configuration node](../config/#velocity-pv), to improve upon the performance and correctly advect (attach) the canvas to the underlaying motion.
* For performance and stability issues on computers running with integrated graphics

To use it, simply select the objects from which you'd like to unsubdivide and click on the **Unsubdivide Previews** button.

If nothing is selected, the tool will try to unsubdivide **ALL** meshes/shapes in the scene.

## Re-link textures
When opening scenes that were stylized by someone else or from another computer, the texture paths within the _ShaderFX_ materials might not be the same anymore. Re-link textures automatically re-links all existing textures from a specific directory with the click of a button.
