# API

The Flair Python API allows to query and modify render states, save render targets (AOVs), automate processes within custom pipelines and even create your own tools to facilitate Flair workflows!

Everything exposed in this documentation is our front-facing API, which is well documented and thoroughly tested, as these are directly used within our native tools.

Need us to expose other entrypoints? Let the developers know on [Discord]({{site.discord-invite}}).
