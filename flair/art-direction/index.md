As stated in [Getting Started](/flair/getting-started/), Art-direction is everything in Flair to achieve exactly the look you are after. For this purpose, we have created different tools at different levels of control to cover most of the _interaction spectrum_.

We have already covered the use of [style presets](/flair/styles/presets/), [global control attributes](/flair/getting-started/globals/), [material presets](/flair/materials/presets/), [material control attributes](/flair/materials/flair-shader/) and [proxy control materials](/flair/materials/proxy-material/). Now we continue introducing the tools to art-direct things further, even beyond just using globals and material attributes.

It's important to remember that the art-direction at each level of control is bound to the 3D scene. However, one can easily export and import the art-direction across scenes using the [Import/Export tool](/flair/styles/import-export/).

* [**Bulk Attribute**](bulkattr) - `BULK` in the [Flair shelf](/flair/getting-started/flair-shelf/), is a convenience tool to change multiple materials in bulk (batch) at the same time.

* [**NoiseFX**](noisefx) - `NFX` in the [Flair shelf](/flair/getting-started/flair-shelf/), is a tool to procedurally assign effects onto the materials of selected objects.

* [**VertexFX**](vertexfx) - `VFX` in the [Flair shelf](/flair/getting-started/flair-shelf/), is a tool to assign effects onto selected objects/components by painting on its vertices.

These tools cover the lower level of control and allow to polish the look with the right effects, exactly where they are needed.
