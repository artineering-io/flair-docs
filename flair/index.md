# Overview
Flair is a **real-time stylized rendering engine** for Autodesk Maya.
The engine consists of **two core elements**:

* The **art-direction toolset** contains the tools to art-direct the different stylization effects available for each style. These will allow you to direct the style towards your vision.

* The **stylizations** are the shading pipelines that generate the style. Flair features signature styles out-of-the-box such as watercolor, frayed, sketch, cutout and the cat style. In addition, the new Flair graph shader allows you to modify or even generate your own shading pipelines to create your own unique style.

The core components are complemented by our custom materials

Why real-time? Stylized rendering thrives when creative choices can be taken immediately instead of waiting for images to render, so we don't settle for less.

However, real-time engines also have their limitations and Flair is no exception. The more complex the scene and the effects that you want to have are, the more powerful of a computer youo will need, so make sure to check the recommended [requirements](#requirements).
