The bulk attribute tool allows to easily change settings and attributes of multiple _MNPRX_ materials at the same time. Its functionality resembles the _Attribute Editor_, but it allows to modify all selected objects at once. The tool window can be opened by clicking on the `blk` [shelf icon](../shelf).
