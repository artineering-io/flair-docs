## Flair breakdown

Flair is a **real-time stylized rendering engine** for Autodesk Maya which consists of **three core elements**

* The [**styles**](./styles) stylize images using shader pipelines.

* The [**materials**](./materials) render the 3D shading information and AOVs of objects.

* The [**art-direction tools**](./art-direction) control the different effects available for each style.

The **combination** of these core elements **make Flair a unique framework** to produce **stylized art-directed 3D graphics**.
This is **complemented by the real-time** performance making creative choices immediate, allowing you to **iterate faster towards your final vision**.

Each core element is thoroughly documented here, together with the [**setup and activation**](./setup) of Flair, the [**rendering tools**](./rendering) and other miscellaneous functions found in the [**Flair toolbox**](./toolbox).

Finally, while Flair is production-proven and continuously improved, we have made sure to also document its [**limitations**](./limitations) compared to other offline (non-realtime) renderers.
