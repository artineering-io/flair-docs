# Styles

Styles within Flair are created through shader pipelines that are defined either internally or using the [Flair graph](./graph).
These pipelines are controlled via parameters that are normally exposed as attributes in the [globals node](/flair/getting-started/globals/) of the style.

The documentation herein covers everything there is to know about working with Flair styles.
* Load and save styles with [presets](./presets).
* Control signature Flair styles with global attributes and learn what each one attribute does within the [Style Library](./library).
* Edit a shader pipeline or even make one to create your own style with the new [Flair graph](./graph)
* Export and import the styles, together with the stylization (art-direction), across scenes using the [Import/Export tool](./import-export).
