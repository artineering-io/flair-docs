## Style breakdown

The _fray_ shader style, similar to the [_warp_ shader style](/flair/styles/library/warp/), emulates the broken edges commonly found in paintings, in 3D. It also provides other painterly effects often found using traditional painting media such as pigment turbulence, edge darkening, canvas textures and more.

The broken edges from the fray style are generated by displacing pixels iteratively, one pixel at a time, in a direction defined by the feature noise of the material. This noise is fractalized so that the broken edges retain the same pixel size, no matter how close/far the object is from the camera. To avoid frayed edges to occur on top of pixels that are in front, the depth is also displaced and taken into account.

This shader style depends on the [Flair material](/flair/materials/flair-shader), which can be assigned onto any mesh object. The material embeds painterly reflectance models and supports the art-direction framework of Flair. The material also contains a	 `Animated` setting attribute, which allows to attach the broken edges to animated objects.

TAA is be required to average out sub-pixel flickering at high frequencies. Also keep in mind that longer frayed edges are much more prone to flickering than shorter ones.
{:. info} 

The fray shader style may not have all features that you need. So please let us know if [we can help](https://artineering.io/agency) polish the look exactly to your requirements and pipeline.

In this page, we only document global attributes specific to the fray shader style. To learn more about other global attributes, please refer to the [globals node documentation](/flair/getting-started/globals).

## Considerations

### Attach frayed distortions onto objects
Activate the `Animated` attribute within the materials to bake the frayed distortion position onto animated objects.

### Nurbs surfaces
Nurbs surfaces can't save any data in vertex colors, so warped distortions won't stick onto the objects and it won't be possible to use VertexFX on them.
