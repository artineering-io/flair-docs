## Style breakdown

Flair Graph shader styles, usually prepended by *g_* within the [style presets](/flair/styles/presets), are defined using the [Flair Graph node interface](/flair/graph/). This interface allows artists to use, modify and even create their own shader styles through a node-based framework.

Styles defined through the Flair graph can be unique per shot, scene, sequence or production. We have recreated most of our C++ styles using the Flair graph, so these share the same documentation.

If you are using a graph style from someone outside of _Artineering_, make sure to request and read the documentation for that style from the creator.
