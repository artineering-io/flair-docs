### Sketch Lines
Additional offset lines that outline the form of the 3D geometry and are therefore generated from various AOVs. The influence of each data type to generate sketch lines can be changed in [Advanced Controls](/#advanced-controls).
The dropdown menu defines how many sketch lines are created. Note that the [Feature Noise](/flair/materials/flair-shader/#feature-noise) must be enabled in the Material Attributes, to see an effect on this selection.

#### Sketch Type
The sketch type dictates how many sketch lines will be generated.

#### Sketch Intensity
Strength of the generated sketch line(s). A lower intensity will alpha-blend the sketch line(s) with the render. This can also be art-directed with [VertexFX](/flair/art-direction/vertexfx/) and [NoiseFX](/flair/art-direction/noisefx/).

#### Sketchiness
Offset intensity of the sketch line(s) in relation to the outline. This can also be art-directed with [VertexFX](/flair/art-direction/vertexfx/) and [NoiseFX](/flair/art-direction/noisefx/).

</figure>

#### Sketchiness Max
Defines the maximum offset the generated sketch line(s) may have.

#### Sketch Width Range
The sketch line(s)' width range is directly linked to the [Line Width](/flair/styles/library/lines/#line-width) and [Line Width Range](/flair/styles/library/lines/#line-width-range).

</figure>

#### Sketch Width Factor
The sketch line(s)' width factor is directly linked to the [Line Width](/flair/styles/library/lines/#line-width) and [Line Width Factor](/flair/styles/library/lines/#line-width-factor).

</figure>

#### Sketchiness Frequency
Defines the base frequency of the feature noise controlling the sketchy offset. A higher frequency will shorten the distance between the sketch line(s) peaks, whereas a lower frequency elongates the distance, resulting in smoother and longer waves. The frequency is directly linked to the global World Scale.

</figure>

#### Sketchiness Phase
Shifts the base feature noise value around, creating new shapes of sketch line(s) at different values. Useful when you want a different sketchy deformation or want to vary the sketchiness on a frame-by-frame basis.

{: .info}
As the sketch line(s) is generated from noise in 3D, make sure to toggle the deformed attribute in materials if they are animated/deformed so that the sketch line(s) is baked in place.

#### Sketch Density
The density of the sketch line(s), whereas a value of 1 equals the objectâ€™s color.  higher density accumulates color, thereby making the sketch line(s) darker.

{: .info}
To see the full effect, the [Sketch Coloration](/flair/styles/library/lines/#sketch-coloration) should be set to 0.

#### Sketch Color
Defines a custom global color for the sketch line(s). The saturation can be adjusted with the slider.

	<figcaption>Sketch color slider between different colors.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Sketch Coloration
How much the sketch line(s) should be of the set _Sketch Color_. This can also be art-directed with [VertexFX](/flair/art-direction/vertexfx/) and [NoiseFX](/flair/art-direction/noisefx/). A negative art-directed coloration will bring the sketch line(s) color back to the albedo.

#### Sketch Light Response
