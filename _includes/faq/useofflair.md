Can I use Flair for my student production?
<div markdown="1">
Yes, of course! As a student, you can either use the Demo version or support us on Patreon for 5â‚¬ per month to get a community license and render at any resolution. Additionally, you can also ask your university to purchase Flair Indie for Education so that you can use it.

Are there floating licenses available?
<div markdown="1">
Not at the moment, though if you are looking to purchase many licenses and need this flexibility, we can add this option. Currently, we only offer online or custom offline licenses. Online licenses are only node-locked to a computer for 12 hours after a previous activation, which means that they could be migrated on the next working day.

Are there offline licenses available?
<div markdown="1">
Yes, custom offline licenses can be offered to studios whose workstations don't have internet access due to security reasons. These are only offered when purchasing 10 or more licenses and are a bit more expensive as they require custom branded builds of Flair for each release.
