# Shader Styles

Styles within Flair are created through shader pipelines that are defined either internally or using the [Flair graph](./graph).
These pipelines are controlled via parameters that are normally exposed as attributes in the [globals node](/flair/getting-started/globals/) of the style.

The documentation herein covers everything there is to know about working with Flair styles.
