## Style breakdown

The _warp_ shader style, similar to the [_fray_ shader style](/flair/styles/library/fray/), emulates the broken edges commonly found in paintings, in 3D. It also provides other painterly effects often found using traditional painting media such as pigment turbulence, edge darkening, canvas textures and more.

	</figure>
</div>

The broken edges from the warp shader style are generated by rendering a separate inflated 3D noise for each object. This noise is fractalized so that the broken edges retain the same pixel size, no matter how close/far the object is from the camera. Finally, the fractalized noise distorts the image to achieve the warped look. Individual meshes can be excluded entirely from the noise calculations by toggling the noise instances using the [Flair Toolbox](/flair/toolbox).

This shader style works on any Maya material, even with VertexFX art-direction on the warp amplitude and feathering. However using the [Flair material](/flair/materials/flair-shader) unlocks painterly reflectance models and supports the entire art-direction framework of Flair. The material also contains a `Animated` setting attribute, which allows to attach the broken edges to animated objects. This can also be achieved on other materials using the [Warp Settings](#warp-settings).

While production-proven, the warp shader style may not have all features that you need. So please let us know if [we can help](https://artineering.io/agency) polish the look exactly to your requirements and pipeline.

## Attribute breakdown

In this section, we only document global attributes specific to the warp shader style. To learn more about other global attributes, please see the [globals node documentation](/flair/getting-started/globals).

## Warp Settings

The Warp settings allow additional functionality for the Warp shader style. The available settings can be found in the [Flair toolbox](/flair/toolbox), once you click on the `Warp settings` button.

### Toggle instance on selected
This button will toggle the inflated instance on the selected objects on/off. Especially useful for transparent objects, so that only objects behind warp the end result.

### Bake effect positions on selected
On Flair materials, this button is a convenience function that will check the `Animated` setting attribute on materials where the selected objects have been assigned into. With non-Flair materials, this is the **only way** to attach the warp distortions to animated objects.

------------------------
------------------------


## Considerations

### Attach warped distortions onto objects
Activate the `Animated` attribute within the materials to bake the warped distortion position onto animated objects.

### Nurbs surfaces
Nurbs surfaces can't save any data in vertex colors, so warped distortions won't stick onto the objects and it won't be possible to use VertexFX on them.

### Inflation
- Vertex normals in objects that are not sub-divided will need to be averaged for hard-edged objects. Otherwise, each face vertex has its own normal and inflation will leave gaps between each inflated face, creating incoherent warped distortions.
- Thin objects should have faces on both sides for the object to inflate correctly.

### Warnings
`...due to multiply-instanced child`
Whenever you get this warning, uncheck the *Enable* attribute in the Warp globals to remove the instances, make the edits that you previously wanted to do and re-enable the instances.
