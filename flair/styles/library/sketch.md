## Style breakdown

The _sketch_ shader style is all about generating lines for all kinds of linework. From clean lines to the more rough sketch lines, you can control and art-direct them to match your art. The style also provides other painterly effects often found using traditional painting media such as pigment turbulence....

A series of attributes are provided within the [globals node](/flair/getting-started/globals/) to control and refine the sketch shader style.
