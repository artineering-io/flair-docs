### Advanced Controls
To generate lines, we run an edge-detection algorithm on three different types of data: depth, normals and color. So, whenever there is a difference within neighboring pixels for each data type, an edge is extracted.

There is a specific limit to the difference in depth, normals, and color that needs to be exceeded to extract an edge. This limit, in technical terms, is called a threshold. Advanced controls give access to these thresholds to adjust the generated lines.

#### Depth Edge Threshold
Depth threshold at which a line from _depth_ differences is generated. 0.001 will generate an edge on minuscule depth differences, a higher value will generate an edge only after a certain depth difference has been achieved. 
The depth threshold is directly linked to the global [World Scale](/flair/getting-started/globals/#world-scale) attribute so that the same values can be used at different world scales.

If _Flow Edge Threshold_ and _Color Edge Threshold_ are set to 1.0, a high _Depth Edge Threshold_ will only show lines at silhouettes.

#### Flow Edge Threshold
Flow threshold at which a line from _normal_ differences is generated. 0.001 will generate an edge on minuscule normal differences, whereas 1.0 will remove lines from normals altogether.

Normal maps change the normals and therefore also help generate edges at specific parts of objects.

#### Color Edge Threshold
Color threshold at which a line from _color_ differences is generated. 0.001 will generate an edge on minuscule color differences, whereas 1.0 will remove lines from color altogether. 

Having low color edge thresholds will make the edge detection quite sensitive to noise or grunge in textures.

#### Lighting Edge Blend
Amount of lighting within the color pass to generate edges from. At a _Lighting Edge Blend_ of 0.0, the color will only consist of the albedo. At a _Lighting Edge Blend_ of 1.0, lighting will be applied too the albedo, so edges can also be generated from cast shadows and shading.
