## Cutout Material

The cutout stencil is generated by the cutout material, which needs to be set on all cutout objects. To assign this material on an object, select an object and load the "_\_cutout_" material preset (see [material presets](/software/MNPRX/docs/material-presets)).

The cutout material controls how objects affect the cutout stencil and the paper color. As with the [MNPRX uber material](/software/MNPRX/docs/uber/), the cutout material is divided in optional _Settings_ and _Attributes_.

### Settings
Closed by default, once opened, each _Setting_ allows you to customize what optional features the cutout material should have. Most of these settings are disabled by default, as to avoid unnecessary computations and clutter for artists. If needed, enabling settings will provide the necessary attributes to configure them.

#### VtxControl
Enables the control of stylization effects through the vertex colors. This attribute is automatically managed by _MNPRX_ and is activated as soon as you start using [_PaintFX_](/software/MNPRX/docs/paintfx/).

#### Colored
Overrides the color of the canvas with the color specified in the _Color Tint_ attribute, which is generated when this setting is checked.

#### Transparent
Only shows if the _Colored_ setting is checked, allows to create transparent colored cutouts. The setting creates relevant transparency attributes, [documented here](/software/MNPRX/docs/uber/#transparent).

#### Alpha
Allows the use of alpha masks to modify the cutout stencil. The setting creates relevant alpha attributes, [documented here](/software/MNPRX/docs/uber/#alpha-mask).

#### Displacement
Useful to add geometric detail, which can enhance the cutout silhouette. Displacement and its attributes are [documented here](/software/MNPRX/docs/uber/#displacement).

------------------------

### Attributes
The cutout material attributes modify the behaviour of the cutout material.

#### Cut
If checked, the material will make the object a cutout stencil. Otherwise, the object will not be cutout. This is enabled by default.

#### Cutout Mask
_Cutout Mask_ is an black and white uv-map that defines what parts of the object should be cut-out and which parts should not. This attribute toggles the use of the [_Cutout Mask File_](#cutout-mask-file).

#### Cutout Mask File
Specifies the file path to the _Cutout Mask_. In _Cutout Masks_, white is cut, whereas black is uncut. The path can be absolute or relative to the project root directory.

#### Color Tint
The color of the canvas is overridden with the custom color set by this attribute. This attribute is only available if the _Colored_ setting is enabled.

------------------

### Stylization (proc.)
When the [_NoiseFX_](./../noisefx) tool has been used on the material, the _Stylization (procedural)_ section will appear at the bottom of the _Attribute Editor_. This section contains all the procedural attributes that the _NoiseFX_ tool creates and modifies. Therefore, you can mostly ignore these attributes within the material, unless you want to key and animate them.
